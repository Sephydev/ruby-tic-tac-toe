# Tic-Tac-Toe Ruby

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe Ruby project! The project idea come from The Odin Project. It consist of making a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game with Ruby, where two players will "fight" each other. The rule are the same as the typical Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## How to use ?

To use it, you must install Ruby. Once ruby is install, download the project.
Once the project is downloaded, you can launch it with your terminal :
  1. Go to the directory containing the project with the Terminal (use cd)
  2. Type 'ruby main.rb' in the Terminal
  3. Just follow the instruction to play!
  4. If you want to restart a game, redo the step 2
